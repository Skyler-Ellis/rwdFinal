             Community College is a wonderful public institution located in County, State. It is supervised by The Board of Regents and prides itself on serving the community. You can find our main campus situated in the beautiful west County, with the added convenience of four satellite campuses in the surrounding area. Initially named Technical Community College, we transitioned to our current name on July 1, 2009. We are proud to continue the legacy of the esteemed State Technical Institute at County ("STIC"), which was established back in 1974.
